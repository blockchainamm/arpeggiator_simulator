# Arpeggiator audio tones simulator

This python script generates arpeggiator audio tones for the sequence of given notes.

For example for the notes in order 'C4', 'A3', 'G4', 'C3', 'E5', 'F4', 'C4' 

arpeggiator pattern is generated for 10 times for each note to simulate the arpeggiator sound. 

The notes and frequencies of the notes played respectively are as follows,

Row : 48 and column : 6  of note C4 in the data frame pnotes_df\
The frequencies of ascending notes of the major chords for note C4\
261.6256\
